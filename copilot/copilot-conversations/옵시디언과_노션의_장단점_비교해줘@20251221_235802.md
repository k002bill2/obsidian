**user**: 옵시디언과 노션의 장단점 비교해줘

**ai**: Okay, let's discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Obsidian and Notion, focusing on Clean Code principles as we discussed earlier.

Obsidian and Notion both offer robust note-taking capabilities, but they cater to different workflows. Obsidian excels in building interconnected knowledge graphs, prioritizing long-term thinking and serendipitous discovery through linking [[notes]]. Notion, conversely, is a more versatile workspace, blending note-taking with project management and database features [^1].

Notion’s flexibility can sometimes lead to information overload, potentially hindering maintainability if not carefully structured [^1]. Obsidian’s focus on linked [[notes]] encourages a more deliberate and organized approach to knowledge building.
