**user**: RAG 구축하기 위해 준비할것들을 알려줘

**ai**: Okay, let's break down the preparation needed for building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. Here's a categorized list of what you'll need, based on the notes you've provided and general RAG best practices:

**1. Data & Knowledge Base:**

*   **Your Data Sources:** This is the *most* critical part. Identify the documents, websites, databases, or other sources containing the information you want your RAG system to use.  This could be:
    *   PDFs, Word documents, text files
    *   Websites (you'll need to scrape or use APIs)
    *   Databases (SQL, NoSQL)
    *   Internal knowledge bases
*   **Chunking Strategy:**  How you break down your data into smaller pieces (chunks) is crucial.  Consider:
    *   **Chunk Size:** Experiment with different chunk sizes (e.g., 256 tokens, 512 tokens).  Smaller chunks are more precise but might lose context. Larger chunks can capture more context but can be harder to manage.
    *   **Overlap:**  Include some overlap between chunks to maintain context across boundaries.
    *   **Metadata:**  Attach metadata to each chunk (e.g., source document name, section title, date) – this helps with filtering and understanding.

**2. Embedding Model & Vector Database:**

*   **Embedding Model:** This converts your text chunks into numerical vectors (embeddings).  Popular choices include:
    *   **OpenAI Embeddings:** (easiest to get started with, but costs money)
    *   **Hugging Face Models:** (many open-source options, more control, but requires more setup) – e.g., Sentence Transformers
*   **Vector Database:** This stores the embeddings and allows for efficient similarity searches.
    *   **Pinecone:** (Managed, scalable, good for production)
    *   **Weaviate:** (Open-source, flexible, good for experimentation)
    *   **ChromaDB:** (Open-source, easy to get started with, great for local development)
    *   **Milvus:** (Open-source, high-performance)

**3. LLM (Large Language Model):**

*   **Choose an LLM:** This is the model that generates the final response based on the retrieved context.
    *   **OpenAI Models:** (GPT-3.5, GPT-4 – powerful, but costs money)
    *   **Hugging Face Models:** (Many open-source LLMs – Llama 2, Mistral, etc. – requires more setup and potentially more powerful hardware)

**4. RAG Pipeline Components & Tools:**

*   **Vector Search Library:**  A library to handle the similarity search within the vector database.  Examples:
    *   LangChain
    *   LlamaIndex
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting effective prompts to guide the LLM to use the retrieved context correctly.  This is *critical* for RAG performance.
*   **Frameworks/Libraries:**
    *   **LangChain:** A popular framework that simplifies many RAG tasks.
    *   **LlamaIndex:** Another framework focused on indexing and querying data.

**5. Infrastructure & Setup:**

*   **Compute Resources:**  You'll need a machine (or cloud instance) with enough RAM and processing power to run the embedding model, vector database, and LLM.
*   **API Keys:**  You'll likely need API keys for OpenAI or other services.
*   **Development Environment:**  Python is the most common language for RAG development.

**Key Considerations (Based on the Notes):**

*   **Python:**  Most RAG systems are built using Python.
*   **Chunking:**  Careful chunking is essential for good performance.
*   **LLM Integration:**  The LLM is the core of the system, so choose one that fits your needs and budget.
*   **Prompt Engineering:**  A well-designed prompt is crucial for getting the LLM to use the retrieved context effectively.

To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me:

*   What kind of data are you planning to use in your RAG system? (e.g., documents, websites, databases)
*   What's your technical background? (e.g., are you comfortable with Python, cloud computing, etc.)
