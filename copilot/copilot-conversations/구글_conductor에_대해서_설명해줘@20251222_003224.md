**ai**: Okay, let's explore Google Conductor. Based on the notes you've recently created, here's a breakdown of what we know about Google Conductor:

**Google Conductor: AI-Driven Specification-Centric Development Framework**

The note [[NotebookLM/구글 Conductor_ 바이브 코딩을 넘어선 설계 중심 개발 2025-12-21.md]] describes Google Conductor as a framework that goes beyond "vibe coding" and focuses on design-centric development using AI. Here's a summary of the key points:

*   **Beyond Vibe Coding:** It challenges the trend of relying heavily on intuition and "vibe coding" in AI model development.
*   **Specification-Centric:** Conductor emphasizes defining the desired behavior and specifications of the AI model upfront, rather than just letting the AI learn from data.
*   **Design-Centric:** It’s about designing the model’s architecture and capabilities from the start, ensuring it meets the intended goals.
*   **AI-Driven:**  The AI component of Conductor assists in translating these specifications into concrete model designs and implementations.

Do you want me to delve deeper into any specific aspect of Google Conductor, such as its relationship to Gemini Canvas, or would you like me to search your vault for more information?
