**ai**: Okay, let's explore Google Conductor. Based on the notes you've recently created, here's a breakdown of what we know about Google Conductor:

**Google Conductor: AI-Driven Specification-Centric Development Framework**

The note [[NotebookLM/구글 Conductor_ 바이브 코딩을 넘어선 설계 중심 개발 2025-12-21.md]] describes Google Conductor as a framework that goes beyond "vibe coding" and focuses on design-centric development using AI. Here's a summary of the key points:

*   **Beyond Vibe Coding:** It challenges the trend of relying heavily on intuition and "vibe coding" in AI model development.
*   **Specification-Centric:** Conductor emphasizes defining the desired behavior and specifications of the AI model upfront, rather than just letting the AI learn from data.
*   **Design-Centric:** It’s about designing the model’s architecture and capabilities from the start, ensuring it meets the intended goals.
*   **AI-Driven:**  The AI component of Conductor assists in translating these specifications into concrete model designs and implementations.

Do you want me to delve deeper into any specific aspect of Google Conductor, such as its relationship to Gemini Canvas, or would you like me to search your vault for more information?

**ai**: Okay, let's explore the characteristics of different AI models. Based on the note [[NotebookLM/AI 모델 유형 및 특성 비교 2025-12-21.md]], here’s a breakdown of the key distinctions:

**AI Model Types and Characteristics**

| Model Type          | Key Characteristics                                                              | Strengths                                                              | Weaknesses                                                              | Typical Use Cases                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Large Language Models (LLMs)** | Massive datasets, excels at text generation, understanding, and translation. | Creative content generation, conversational AI, complex reasoning.       | Can be prone to hallucinations, requires significant computational resources. | Chatbots, content creation, summarization, translation.                       |
| **Diffusion Models** | Generates images from text prompts, excels at photorealistic image generation. | High-quality image generation, creative visual content creation.          | Can be computationally intensive, prompt engineering is crucial.          | Image generation, artistic design, photo editing.                             |
| **Reinforcement Learning Models** | Learns through trial and error, optimizing for a specific reward signal. | Solving complex control problems, robotics, game playing.                | Requires careful reward function design, can be unstable to train.        | Robotics, game AI, autonomous driving, resource management.                    |
| **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** | Operates on graph-structured data, understanding relationships between entities. | Analyzing networks, recommendation systems, drug discovery.              | Requires structured data, can be complex to implement.                   | Social network analysis, drug discovery, fraud detection, knowledge graphs. |

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Hybrid Models:** Many modern AI systems combine multiple model types to leverage their strengths.
*   **Continuous Evolution:** The field of AI is rapidly evolving, and new model types and techniques are constantly emerging.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these model types, or perhaps explore a specific use case where a particular model would be suitable?  For example, would you like to know more about how LLMs are used in chatbots?
