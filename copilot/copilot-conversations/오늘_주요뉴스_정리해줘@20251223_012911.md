**user**: 오늘 주요뉴스 정리해줘
[Timestamp: 2025/12/23 01:29:11]

**ai**: Okay, the user asked for today's main news summary. Let me check the recent conversations. The last interaction was about Google's recent updates, including Gemini 1.5 Pro and AI chatbot integration in search. Also, there was a conversation about fine-tuning in AI models and a Clean Code guide. But the user's current query is in Korean, asking for today's main news.

Looking at the provided context, the only relevant information is from the Google Recent Updates conversation. The user might want a summary of that. However, the current time is 2025-12-23, and the previous Google update was on 2025-12-22. Since the user is asking for today's news, but the latest info is from yesterday, maybe there's no new data. But the assistant should check if there's any other context. The other conversations are about Clean Code and fine-tuning, which don't relate to news. 

The user might be expecting the assistant to use the Google updates info as the main news. However, the instructions say to base the answer only on the provided context. Since the context doesn't include today's news, the assistant should state that there's no relevant information. But wait, the Google update was on the 22nd, which is yesterday. The user is asking for today's news, so maybe there's nothing new. Therefore, the answer should indicate that there's no information available for today's main news.
The provided context does not include information about today's (2025-12-23) main news. The most recent updates mentioned are from December 22, 2025, related to Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro and AI chatbot integration in search [^1]. For the latest news, please check updated sources or provide additional context.
