**user**: 웹훅에 대해 설명해줘
[Timestamp: 2025/12/22 22:57:09]

**ai**: Okay, the user is asking me to explain what a webhook is. Let me start by recalling what I know about webhooks. From my previous learning, a webhook is a way for an application to provide real-time information to another application. It's like a callback mechanism where one service notifies another when something happens.

Wait, I should check the context provided. The user mentioned that I should base my answer only on the given context. But looking at the context, there's no specific information about webhooks. The recent conversations include topics like Clean Code, Google updates, and fine-tuning in AI, but nothing about webhooks. 

Hmm, the user might expect me to use general knowledge, but the instructions say to answer based only on the provided context. Since there's no mention of webhooks in the context, I can't cite any sources. However, the user also said if I don't have access to something, I should rely on the context. But in this case, the context doesn't have the information. 

Wait, the user's query is in Korean: "웹훅에 대해 설명해줘" which means "Explain webhooks." But the context doesn't have any info on webhooks. According to the rules, I shouldn't mention that I don't have access. Instead, I should answer based on the context. But since there's no info, maybe I need to state that there's no relevant information in the provided context. 

But the user might be expecting me to use my own knowledge. However, the instructions are strict: answer based only on the given context. Since there's no info on webhooks here, I should inform the user that the context doesn't cover this topic. But I need to check again if I missed any part of the context. 

Looking back at the recent_conversations, there's nothing about webhooks. The sources mentioned are about Clean Code, Google's Gemini, and fine-tuning. So, no relevant sources here. Therefore, I should respond that the context doesn't have information on webhooks. But the user might be testing if I can handle when the context is insufficient. 

Alternatively, maybe I can explain webhooks using general knowledge but without citing sources. However, the instructions say to answer based only on the context. Since there's no info, I should say that there's no relevant information in the provided context. 

So, the correct approach is to state that the context doesn't contain information about webhooks. But I need to make sure I'm not violating any rules. The user also mentioned not to mention lack of access, but the context is the provided information. Since the context doesn't have the info, it's acceptable to say that there's no relevant information.
The context provided does not contain information about webhooks. Please provide additional context or refer to relevant materials for an explanation.
